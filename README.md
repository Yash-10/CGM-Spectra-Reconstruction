# Circumgalactic Medium - Spectrum Reconstruction

This repository contains the analysis done as a part of the [CGM challenge in ML4SCI 2021](https://github.com/ML4SCI/ML4SCIHackathon/tree/main/CircumgalacticMediumChallenge).

## Approach

**Pre-processing**:

The input spectra was rebinned to suppress noise and to make the encoder robust to stochastic noise in the input spectra. The motivation of this idea is from *Wang, Guo and Luo, 2016* <sup>1</sup>.

A convolutional autoencoder with Leaky ReLU activations was used. The Adam optimizer was used and a reduce_lr_on_plateau learning rate scheduler was used. Maximum no. of epochs to train was set to 40. A 90%-10% split was used to generate training and validation sets. Latent dimension of 6 was found to yield the lowest reconstruction loss.

## Results

Sample spectra reconstructions:

The reconstruction loss on the testing set is ~0.00406
